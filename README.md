# Python learning Project (Alien Invasion)

This project is made solely for self-study.

Based on materials from the book Eric Matthes — *Python Crash Course* (section/alien_invasion).
The goal is to practice Python and Pygame, as well as work with the project framework and Git.
Also in the images folder, the files are taken from the specified sources of the book, since the author showed only the opening sources.

## How to launch
1. Install dependencies (pygame)
2. Run the main game file (specify the name of your main file)

Example:
``bash
python3 alien_invasion.py
